Exercise 1: Text Processing Fundamentals using MapReduce on the University Hadoop cluster - text extraction from Amazon reviews and chi-square value calculation using MRJob and Python.  
Exercise 2: Part 1: Text Processing and Classification using Spark - text extraction from Amazon reviews and chi-square value calculation using RDD-s. (Scala)  
            Part 2: Datasets/DataFrames: Spark ML and Pipelines - Convert the review texts to a classic vector space representation with TFIDF-weighted features based on the Spark DataFrame/Dataset API by building a transformation pipeline.  
            Part 3: Text Classification -  train a text classifier from the features extracted in Part 2, that can predict the product category from a review's text.  
Exercise 3: Computational Offloading: Object Detection Service with Remote Cloud Execution (AWS) - Yolov3-tiny. (JS/HTML/CSS Frontend, Python backend)
